The application doesn't require any argument to start.

When the application is launched it opens a simple GUI that allows the user to insert some basket items into a basket and then calculate the amount of taxes by printing the receipt.

There is also a test class: test.java.core.TaxesCalculatorTest which contains some unit tests that can be used to test the application.
